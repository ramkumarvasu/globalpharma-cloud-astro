## When ACE inhibitors are used

ACE inhibitors are used to prevent, treat or improve symptoms in conditions such as: High blood pressure, also called hypertension. Coronary artery disease. Heart failure. Diabetes. Certain chronic kidney diseases. Heart attacks. Scleroderma, a disease that involves hardening of the skin and connective tissues. Migraines. Sometimes, another blood pressure medicine, such as a diuretic or calcium channel blocker, is used with an ACE inhibitor. ACE inhibitors should not be taken with an angiotensin receptor blocker, an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor or a direct renin inhibitor. Side effects Side effects of ACE inhibitors may include: Dry cough. Too much potassium in the blood. Extreme tiredness or dizziness from blood pressure going too low. Headaches. Loss of taste. Rarely, short-term worsening of kidney function. Rarely, ACE inhibitors can cause swelling under the skin. If swelling occurs in the throat, it can be life-threatening. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve), decrease how well ACE inhibitors work. Taking ACE inhibitors during pregnancy increases the risk of birth defects in the baby. If you're pregnant or plan to become pregnant, other options may be available to treat high blood pressure. Talk to your health care professional if you have any questions about the medicines you take.

## Types of Clinical Trials available - Updated 5th Sep 2024

There are a variety of clinical trials regularly enrolling candidates to test the efficacy and safety of potential new treatments, therapies, devices, and more for the healthcare field. Clinical trials are categorized by the medical condition or disease they aim to study. Here are some common types of clinical trials based on disease areas:

Oncology Clinical Trials: These trials focus on cancer treatments, including new chemotherapy drugs, radiation therapies, immunotherapies, and targeted therapies. Oncology trials may also study ways to prevent cancer or manage its symptoms.

Neurology Clinical Trials: Neurology trials study diseases of the nervous system, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis. These trials often explore new drugs, rehabilitation techniques, and diagnostic tools.

Infectious Disease Clinical Trials: Infectious disease trials study the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Examples include trials for HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, and emerging infections like COVID-19.

Cardiovascular Clinical Trials: These trials investigate treatments for heart-related conditions, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, and heart failure. They may involve new medications, lifestyle interventions, or medical devices like stents and pacemakers.
